This repository contains five interview assignments. There are test codes for every component. 

1) binary adder, it adds one to a sequence of binary numbers representing one binary number (1010 => 1011, 1110 => 1111, 111 => 1000, etc)

2) order book, Since it was an interview assignment, I would like not to describe what the business logic is. There are test cases describing logic for each class. The central core algorithm is complex as this business requirement was in a new domain (I never worked on order book previously).

3) cashier

4) supermarket, the program should work out the total price (with promotions applied) for a given list of items

5) transaction, when there is a transaction or a list of transactions, the program should yield a result of validating them.
